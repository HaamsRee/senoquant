# Settings

The Settings tab provides global preferences for the plugin. It's currently mostly a placeholder for future options.

## Options

### Preload segmentation models on startup

**Default:** Enabled.

When enabled, all discovered segmentation models are instantiated and loaded into memory as soon as the Segmentation tab is opened. This reduces latency when running segmentation for the first time.

It's mostly a placeholder. This is the default behavior every time napari is started and is not saved across sessions.
